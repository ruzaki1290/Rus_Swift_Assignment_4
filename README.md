## Overview 🔍

This program defines the Camper superclass and three protocols: Trailer, WaterSystem, and ElectricSystem. 🚐 The primary objective of this system is to enable users to fill up and utilize the water tank for a shower, running on an engine powered by a battery. These protocols are interconnected and intended to be used in a specific order. More detailed usage instructions and explanations are provided below.

## How to Use 🔧

1. To initiate the process of draining the water tank for a shower, use the following function:

```Swift
trailerParkBoys.drainWaterTank()
```

2. If the water is not flowing, ensure that the shower switch is turned on. Verify the status of the switch by calling:

```Swift
trailerParkBoys.displayShowerSwitch()
```

3. If the switch is off, toggle it on/off using this function:

```Swift
trailerParkBoys.showerSwitch()
```

4. When the shower switch is on but the water is still not running, you may need to activate the electrical power. Start the engine with the following function:

```Swift
trailerParkBoys.engineStart()
```

5. With the shower switch on and the engine running, you can now drain the water tank and enjoy your shower. Have a refreshing experience! 🚿😌
