## About 🔎

This program allows the Camper superclass and three protocols: Trailer, WaterSystem and ElectricSystem. The main purpose of this system is to allow the user to be able to fill up and use the water tank for shower, which is running on engine, which is powered by a battery.  All of the protocols are interconnected with each other and are ment to be used in order. Details of usage and further explanations will follow.

## Usage 🔧

1. You want to take a shower and turn on the switch for the water to run. In order to do that, you call this function:  

```Swift

trailerParkBoys.drainWaterTank()

```

2. However, the watter is not running. It might be that you have to turn on the switch first. To check whether the switch is on, you call this function:

```Swift

trailerParkBoys.displayShowerSwitch()

```

3. If the switch is off, you use this function to tuggle switch on and off:

```Swift

trailerParkBoys.showerSwitch()

```

4. The switch is on, but the watter is still not running, because you need electirc power as well. Call this function to turn on the power:

```

trailerParkBoys.engineStart()

```

5. Now, when the shower switch is ON and engine is running, you should be able to drain the water tank and take shower 🚿 Enjoy! 😌
